    "Bayes’ theorem gives a principled way to *reverse* conditional probabilities — it allows us to compute the probability of a hypothesis \\(A\\) given observed data \\(B\\), using the (often easier to estimate) probability of the data given the hypothesis \\(P(B\\mid A)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential for **updating beliefs** when new evidence appears — forming the mathematical core of **Bayesian inference**, which underpins many areas like machine learning, trading signal modeling, and medical diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often, we can easily model how data arises **if** we know the cause \\(A\\) → \\(P(B\\mid A)\\)\n",
